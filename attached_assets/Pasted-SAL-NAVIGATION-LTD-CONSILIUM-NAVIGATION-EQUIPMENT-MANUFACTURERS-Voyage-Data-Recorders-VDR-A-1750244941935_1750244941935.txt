Voyage Data Recorders (VDR)

A proactive incident prevention tool

SAL VDR and S-VDR not only fulfill SOLAS requirements, they also meet our customer's high demands on reliability and incident follow-up possibilities, such as outstanding voyage data playback options. We offer a broad range of voyage data-based cloud applications for safety management and proactive incident prevention, as well as remote diagnostics for cost-efficient maintenance and APT.

Discover the value of your voyage data

Since the VDR records a lot of signals on the vessel, it is a very valuable data central. We provide options for real-time data streaming from the VDR to other systems for smooth integration and value-creating data usage and analysis. Ask us about the possibilities in your particular project!

The SAL VDR playback software is intuitive and requires no configuration by the user.

Made for vessels in all segments

Based on experience from thousands of installations throughout the years, our VDRs have been designed to allow for quick and efficient installation. Regardless of the age of the vessels and their equipment, our interface units make it possible to connect and record the necessary signals as well as additional signals if desired  on any vessel in any segment that requires a VDR or S-VDR.
